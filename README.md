# ExploreML 2020

ExploreML DSCPESU is finally here!

This one-day intensive workshop features the importance and innovation of machine learning and discusses at the surface level, the ideas of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning and specialised training in neural networks, using Tensorflow and Keras.

The resources for this event can be found in this repository, including the code demonstrations curated for understanding the various frameworks of machine learning and the presentations delivered by our keynotes and facilitators.

Please ensure to quote and cite references to our resources if you happen to use them in your activities or projects.
